# 📖 The Master Guide to NEPSE Scrip (Stock) Analytics

> *A comprehensive, beginner-friendly manual explaining every metric, chart, and feature in the institutional NEPSE Scrip Analytics Suite.*

## 🌟 1. Introduction & Purpose

When analyzing stocks on the **Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE)**, understanding who is participating in a specific stock is critical for making informed market decisions.

While **Broker Analytics** tracks the market-wide portfolio of a single brokerage firm, **Scrip Analytics** (`script.html`) flips the lens to focus entirely on **individual stocks (e.g. SHIVM, NABIL, SONA, HDL)**.

It answers key questions:
- Which stocks are seeing the highest turnover and institutional volume?
- Which brokers are the dominant **net buyers** vs **net sellers** in a stock?
- At what average execution prices (**Buy VWAP** vs **Sell VWAP**) did brokers trade?
- How concentrated is buying volume (e.g., *are 3 brokers controlling 65% of all buying volume?*)?
- At what exact times of the day did **large block / whale trades** execute?
- What are the direct **broker-to-broker trade routes** (who supplied the stock to whom)?

## 🧭 2. Global Navigation

The platform provides a unified top navigation bar across all three views:
- **`📄 Raw Floorsheet` (`index.html`)**: Search, filter, and page through raw transaction records.
- **`🏢 Broker Analytics` (`visual.html`)**: Analyze brokerage firms' market share, portfolio allocations, and trading timelines.
- **`📊 Scrip Analytics` (`script.html`)**: Deep dive into individual stocks, broker concentration, VWAP curves, and block deals.

## 🔍 3. Core Concepts & Metric Definitions

### 3.1. LTP vs. VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)
- **LTP (Last Traded Price)**: The price of the very last executed contract for the stock in the session.
- **VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)**: The true weighted average price at which all shares were traded throughout the session:
  $$\text{VWAP} = \frac{\sum (\text{Quantity} \times \text{Rate})}{\sum \text{Quantity}}$$
- **Why it matters**: If LTP is trading above VWAP, buyers have been willing to pay higher prices late in the session. If LTP is below VWAP, the stock faced selling pressure toward the close.

---

### 3.2. Broker Buy VWAP vs. Sell VWAP
For every broker that traded a stock, the system calculates their separate execution averages:
- **Buy VWAP**: Average price at which this broker *bought* shares.
  $$\text{Buy VWAP} = \frac{\text{Buy Value}}{\text{Buy Quantity}}$$
- **Sell VWAP**: Average price at which this broker *sold* shares.
  $$\text{Sell VWAP} = \frac{\text{Sell Value}}{\text{Sell Quantity}}$$
- **Why it matters**: Reveals whether a broker was accumulating at lower levels and unloading at higher levels, or vice versa.

---

### 3.3. Net Flow & Flow Status (`🟢 NET BUYING` / `🔴 NET SELLING`)
Floorsheet data captures observed transaction flow during the selected window:
- **Net Flow Quantity**: Total shares bought minus total shares sold ($\text{Buy Qty} - \text{Sell Qty}$).
- **Net Flow Value (NPR)**: Total money spent buying minus total money received selling ($\text{Buy Value} - \text{Sell Value}$).
- **🟢 NET BUYING**: $\text{Buy Value} > \text{Sell Value}$ (The broker absorbed more shares than they released).
- **🔴 NET SELLING**: $\text{Sell Value} > \text{Buy Value}$ (The broker released more shares to the market than they bought).

---

### 3.4. Top 3 Buyer Concentration (%)
- **Formula**:
  $$\text{Top 3 Buyer Share \%} = \frac{\text{Volume Bought by Top 3 Buyers}}{\text{Total Stock Volume}} \times 100$$
- **Interpretation**:
  - **$\ge 50\%$ (High Concentration)**: Buying volume is heavily driven by 1 to 3 dominant institutional brokers.
  - **$< 30\%$ (Dispersed / Retail Flow)**: Buying is scattered across dozens of different retail brokers.
