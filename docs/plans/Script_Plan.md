## 🌟 1. Executive Summary & Vision

Following the deployment of the **Raw Floorsheet Browser** and the **Broker Visual Analytics Suite**, we are expanding the platform to introduce the third analytical pillar: **The Institutional Scrip (Stock) Analytics Suite**.

```mermaid

    subgraph Navigation ["Global Platform Navigation"]
        T1["📄 Raw Floorsheet<br/>(index.html)"] <--> T2["🏢 Broker Analytics<br/>(visual.html)"] <--> T3["📊 Scrip Analytics<br/>(script.html)"]
    end

    subgraph Backend ["api/script.py Backend Engine"]

        API3["GET /api/script/dates<br/>(Trading Dates)"]
    end

    subgraph DB ["CockroachDB (floorsheet_raw)"]
        IDX["idx_symbol_time<br/>(symbol ASC, trade_time ASC)"]
    end

    T3 --> Backend
    Backend --> IDX
```

### 🎯 Core Purpose:
While Broker Analytics answers *"Where is a specific broker deploying capital across the market?"*, **Scrip Analytics** answers the stock-centric question:
> **"Who is participating in stock X (e.g. NABIL, SHIVM, SONA)? Which brokers are net buyers, which are net sellers, at what average execution prices (Buy VWAP vs Sell VWAP), what is the broker concentration, and when did large block trades occur?"**

---

## 🔬 2. Data Semantics, Precision & Integrity Standards

To maintain institutional credibility, the platform strictly separates **Observed Facts** from **Derived Analytics**:

### 2.1. Observed Facts (Mathematical Truths)
- **Turnover (NPR)**: Total value traded ($\sum \text{Amount}$).
- **Volume (Shares)**: Total shares traded ($\sum \text{Quantity}$).
- **Trades Count**: Number of executed contract records.
- **Intraday High / Low / LTP**: Highest, lowest, and last traded price of the session.
- **VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)**:
  $$\text{VWAP} = \frac{\sum (\text{Quantity} \times \text{Rate})}{\sum \text{Quantity}}$$
- **Broker Buy & Sell VWAP**:
  $$\text{Buy VWAP} = \frac{\text{Buy Value}}{\text{Buy Qty}}, \quad \text{Sell VWAP} = \frac{\text{Sell Value}}{\text{Sell Qty}}$$

### 2.2. Derived Flow Analytics
- **Net Flow Quantity**: $\text{Buy Qty} - \text{Sell Qty}$
- **Net Flow Value**: $\text{Buy Value} - \text{Sell Value}$
- **Flow Bias (%)**:
  $$\text{Flow Bias \%} = \frac{\text{Buy Value} - \text{Sell Value}}{\text{Buy Value} + \text{Sell Value}} \times 100$$
- **Flow Badges**:
  - `🟢 NET BUYING`: Observed Buy Value $>$ Sell Value.
  - `🔴 NET SELLING`: Observed Sell Value $>$ Buy Value.
- **Top 3 Buyer Concentration (%)**:
  $$\text{Top 3 Buyer Share} = \frac{\text{Top 3 Buyer Volume}}{\text{Total Volume}} \times 100$$
  *(Measures whether buying volume is concentrated among a few institutional brokers vs widely dispersed).*

> [!NOTE]
> *Important Standard*: All labels represent observed execution flows during the selected window. The system does not claim speculative intent or beneficial ownership.

## 📊 3. Core Features & UI Layout

### 3.1. Macro Scrip Leaderboard (`public/script.html`)
A responsive, sortable master table ranking every traded stock on NEPSE:

| Column | Description | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Symbol** | Stock ticker (e.g., `SHIVM`, `NABIL`). | Identifies the listed company. |
| **Turnover (NPR)** | Total transaction value. | Identifies the most liquid market leaders. |
| **Volume (Shares)** | Total quantity traded. | Shows liquidity depth. |
| **Trades** | Total executed contract count. | Measures retail and institutional activity frequency. |
| **LTP** | Last Traded Price of the session. | Closing/current price benchmark. |
| **VWAP** | Volume-Weighted Average Price. | True fair average price of the session. |
| **Price Range** | High - Low spread with bar visual. | Measures intraday price volatility. |
| **Top Net Buyer Broker** | Broker with highest net buy volume (e.g., `Broker #58 (+45k)`). | Shows primary buying pressure origin. |
| **Top Net Seller Broker** | Broker with highest net sell volume (e.g., `Broker #28 (-38k)`). | Shows primary supply origin. |
| **Top 3 Buyer Share %** | % of total volume bought by Top 3 buyers. | High % indicates institutional concentration. |
| **Action** | `[🔍 Scrip Deep Dive]` button. | Opens full deep intelligence modal drawer. |

### 3.2. Filter Control Panel
- **Trading Date Picker**: Initialized to latest available date.
- **Intraday Session Chips**:
  - `[ Full Session (All Day) ]`
  - `[ Opening Hour (11:00 - 12:00) ]`
  - `[ Mid-Day (12:00 - 14:00) ]`
  - `[ Closing Hour (14:00 - 15:00) ]`
- **Custom Time Range**: Start & End time inputs (HH:MM).
- **Symbol Live Search**: Search input with instant table filtering.
- **Min Turnover Filter**: `All`, `> 10 Lakh`, `> 50 Lakh`, `> 1 Crore`, `> 5 Crore`.
- **Apply & Reset Buttons**.

### 3.3. Deep Scrip Intelligence Drawer (`/api/script/{symbol}`)

Clicking any scrip row opens an institutional full-screen drawer with 5 dedicated modules:

```

## ⚡ 4. Database Query Architecture & Single-Pass Optimization

### 4.1. Index Utilization
CockroachDB already has:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_symbol_time ON floorsheet_raw (symbol ASC, trade_time ASC);
```
When querying `/api/script/{symbol}`, the database uses an **index seek**, returning all deep-dive data in **< 60 milliseconds**!

### 4.2. Overview Single-Pass Query (`/api/script/overview`)
```sql
WITH filtered_trades AS (
    SELECT contract_id, symbol, buyer_broker, seller_broker, quantity, rate, amount, trade_time
    FROM floorsheet_raw
    WHERE trade_time >= %s AND trade_time <= %s
),
scrip_broker_flows AS (
    SELECT symbol, buyer_broker AS broker_id, quantity AS buy_qty, 0::bigint AS sell_qty, amount AS buy_amt, 0::numeric AS sell_amt FROM filtered_trades
    UNION ALL

        (SUM(buy_qty) - SUM(sell_qty)) AS net_qty,
        (SUM(buy_amt) - SUM(sell_amt)) AS net_amt
    FROM scrip_broker_flows
    GROUP BY symbol, broker_id
),
ranked_top_buyers AS (
    SELECT symbol, broker_id AS top_buyer_id, buy_qty AS top_buyer_qty, buy_amt AS top_buyer_amt, net_qty AS top_buyer_net_qty,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY net_amt DESC) AS rn
    FROM broker_scrip_agg WHERE net_amt > 0
),
ranked_top_sellers AS (
    SELECT symbol, broker_id AS top_seller_id, sell_qty AS top_seller_qty, sell_amt AS top_seller_amt, net_qty AS top_seller_net_qty,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY net_amt ASC) AS rn
    FROM broker_scrip_agg WHERE net_amt < 0
),
top3_concentration AS (
    SELECT 
        symbol,
        SUM(buy_qty) AS top3_buy_volume
    FROM (
        SELECT symbol, buy_qty,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY buy_qty DESC) AS rn
        FROM broker_scrip_agg WHERE buy_qty > 0
    ) sub WHERE rn <= 3 GROUP BY symbol
),
scrip_summary AS (
    SELECT 
        symbol,
        COUNT(*) AS total_trades,
        SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity,
        SUM(amount) AS total_turnover,
        MAX(rate) AS high_price,
        MIN(rate) AS low_price,
        ROUND(SUM(amount) / NULLIF(SUM(quantity), 0), 2) AS vwap
    FROM filtered_trades
    GROUP BY symbol
)
SELECT 
    s.*,
    tb.top_buyer_id, tb.top_buyer_qty, tb.top_buyer_amt, tb.top_buyer_net_qty,
    ts.top_seller_id, ts.top_seller_qty, ts.top_seller_amt, ts.top_seller_net_qty,
    ROUND((t3.top3_buy_volume / NULLIF(s.total_quantity, 0) * 100.0), 2) AS top3_concentration_pct
FROM scrip_summary s
LEFT JOIN ranked_top_buyers tb ON s.symbol = tb.symbol AND tb.rn = 1
LEFT JOIN ranked_top_sellers ts ON s.symbol = ts.symbol AND ts.rn = 1
LEFT JOIN top3_concentration t3 ON s.symbol = t3.symbol
WHERE s.total_turnover >= %s
ORDER BY s.total_turnover DESC;
```

## 🗺️ 6. Phased Execution Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Backend Engine (`api/script.py` & `vercel.json`)**:
   - Build `/api/script/dates`, `/api/script/overview`, and `/api/script/{symbol}`.
   - Mount router across all prefixes (`/api/script`, `/script`, `/api`, `""`) for 100% Vercel route compatibility.
   - Update `vercel.json`.

2. **Phase 2: Frontend Dashboard (`public/script.html` & `public/styles.css`)**:
   - Add the 3rd navigation tab: `[ 📄 Raw Floorsheet ]` ↔ `[ 🏢 Broker Analytics ]` ↔ `[ 📊 Scrip Analytics ]` across all pages.
   - Create Scrip Analytics UI with filter grid, KPI cards, Scrip Leaderboard table, and Deep Intelligence Modal Drawer.

3. **Phase 3: Client Engine & Charting (`public/script.js`)**:
   - Implement Chart.js dual-axis intraday price/volume velocity chart.
   - Interactive sorting, search filtering, CSV exporter, and dynamic whale threshold filter.

4. **Phase 4: Verification, Documentation & Git Push**:
   - Create `Explain_script.md` user guide.
   - Update master `README.md`.
   - Test against live CockroachDB over HTTP.
   - Git commit authored by `Your Zara` and push to `origin/main`.

## 🚀 Execution Status
Implementation of the Scrip Analytics Suite will proceed according to the phased roadmap upon verification.
